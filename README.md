### Hi there 👋 I'm Ryan Benson

I create software and websites. I spread a lot of joy in the meantime! ✨

Here are some fun things about my side projects that are more or less to learn and have fun!

![Ryan's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ryanbenson&show_icons=true&theme=radical)

#### Current Fun Work 🔭

* I'm consistently working on [learning and playing around with algorithms and problem solving](https://github.com/ryanbenson/laera)
* I'm building a fun Genshin Impact feedback app in React and Node using Redux toolkit
* I'm also creating a Discord bot to help notify you when a product comes back in stock. I had a Go based one, but I'm porting it over to Discord to make it easier to manage

#### Learning 🌱

(Outside of the `laera` repo)

* Woodworking 🪵 🪑
